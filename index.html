    <h1>ALL ABOUT THAT BASS</h1>
    <body>
      Bass is the lowest tuned instrument in the string family, and unlike the
      other stringed instruments, it is tuned in 4ths, not 5ths.

    <body>
      The bass plays a supporting role in the orchestra, adding depth and
      richness into the sound, while also provding rythmic function.

    <h3 id="lem">History</h3>
    <body>
      The bass is the youngest of the stringed instruments, and it is the least
      standardized. What we now recognize as the string bass today, started to
      only come around in the mid-late 1600s. Even still, you will see a lot of
      different tunings for the string bass then, and different varitions of
      string count. Bass then could be anywhere from 3-6 strings! Even still
      today, you could still see many players using a 4 or 5 string bass using
      either a french over-hand gripped bow or the german under-hand gripped
      bow.

    <h4>HATE</h4>
    <body>
      Many people think the bass is useless; THIS IS WRONG! The bass is the
      hardest, coolest, and coolest instrument and those who don't like it,
      suck. IF it wasn't for those damn violinsts, every instrument would be
      bass. This is why no one listens to symponhic music anymore, because there
      is NO BASS.
